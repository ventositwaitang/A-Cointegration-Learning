# Cointegration 
Cointegration is statistical arbitrage for correlated pair rather than simple mean reversion

### Future direction
* to be refined by Grid Search for time-window & stop-profit hyper-param, and calibrating divergent adjusting factor (a basin hopping parameter for long-term drift, with Nadam iteration)

* Model by Linear/ Quadratic(non-linear) Gaussian with neural autograd
