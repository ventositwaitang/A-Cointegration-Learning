Delta convergence with drift term

### Future direction
* to be refined by Grid Search for time-window & stop-profit hyper-param, and calibrating divergent adjusting factor (a basin hopping parameter for long-term drift, with Nadam iteration)

* as Multi-asset Pricing Model by Linear/ Quadratic(non-linear) Gaussian simulation with neural autograd
